Day 1 - Linux Basics
📅 Date: Tuesday, 11th February 2025

🔹 Introduction to Linux
Linux is a free and open-source operating system, similar to Unix.
It is widely used in servers, computers, and even mobile phones.
People prefer Linux because it is secure, stable, and flexible.
Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux lets users fully customize their system.

🔹 What is the Linux Kernel?
The Linux kernel is the heart of the operating system. It connects the software (applications) with the hardware (CPU, memory, and devices). It helps the system run smoothly by managing resources like memory and processing power.

🔹 Basic Linux Commands
Here are some important Linux commands and what they do:

Command Description
pwd Shows the current location (folder) in the system
ls Lists all files and folders in the current directory
cd <directory> Moves to another folder
mkdir <folder_name> Creates a new folder
touch <file_name> Creates an empty file
rm <file_name> Deletes a file
rmdir <directory> Deletes an empty folder
cp <source> <destination> Copies a file or folder
mv <source> <destination> Moves or renames a file/folder
cat <file_name> Displays the content of a file
echo "text" > file.txt Writes text to a file
chmod +x <file> Makes a file executable (for scripts)
uname -a Shows system details
df -h Shows available disk space
free -m Shows available RAM (memory)
🔹 Navigating Files and Folders
pwd → Shows your current location.
ls -la → Lists all files, including hidden ones.
cd .. → Moves one level up (to the previous folder).
cd / → Moves to the root folder (top-level of the system).
🔹 Main Parts of the Linux Kernel
The Linux kernel has different sections that handle various tasks:

1️⃣ Process Management → Runs and manages applications.
2️⃣ Memory Management → Allocates memory to applications.
3️⃣ File System Management → Organizes files and folders.
4️⃣ Device Drivers → Helps software communicate with hardware.
