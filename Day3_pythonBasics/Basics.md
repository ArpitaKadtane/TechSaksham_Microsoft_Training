# Day 2 - Python Basics

## Python Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## Data Structures in Python

### 1. List

A list is an ordered, mutable collection that can store elements of different types.

**Example:**

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana"]
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
```

### 2. Tuple

A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection.

**Example:**

```python
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, "hello")
print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: 20
```

### 3. Dictionary

A dictionary is an unordered, mutable collection of key-value pairs.

**Example:**

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(my_dict["name"])  # Output: Alice
```

## Conditional Statements

### `if`, `elif`, `else`

Used to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.

**Example:**

```python
x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative number")
else:
    print("Zero")
```

## Looping Constructs

### `for` Loop

Used to iterate over sequences like lists and ranges.

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Outputs: 0 1 2 3 4
```
